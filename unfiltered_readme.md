# Unfiltered version

This removes the NSFW filter to improve performance of image generation when used in batch mode.

## How-To

Run:

```
pip install .
```

I also had to install pytorch locally with pip: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

Then you can generate images:

```
python3 generate_images.py
```
